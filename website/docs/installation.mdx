Immer can be installed as a direct dependency, and will work in any ES5 environment:

- Yarn: `yarn add immer`
- NPM: `npm install immer`
- CDN: Exposed global is `immer`
  - Unpkg: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/immer"></script>`
  - JSDelivr: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/immer"></script>`
  - ⚠️ When using a CDN, it is best to check the url in your browser and see what version it resolves to, so that your users aren't accidentally served a newer version in the future when updates are release. So use an url like: https://unpkg.com/immer@6.0.3/dist/immer.umd.production.min.js instead. Substitute `production.min` with `development` in the URL for a development build.

## Pick your Immer version

_This section only applies to version 6 and later_

To make sure Immer is as small as possible, features that are not required by every project has been made opt-in, and have to be enabled explicitly. This ensures that when bundling your application for production, unused features don't take any space.

The following features can be opt-in to:

| Feature | Description | Method to call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [JSON Patch support](./patches.mdx) | Immer can keep track of all the changes you make to draft objects. This can be useful for communicating changes using JSON patches | `enablePatches()` |

Vanilla Immer kicks in at ~5KB gzipped. Every plugin that is enabled adds < 1 KB to that. The breakdown is as follows:

## Immer on older JavaScript environments?

By default `produce` tries to use proxies for optimal performance. However, on older JavaScript engines `Proxy` is not available. For example, when running Microsoft Internet Explorer or React Native (if < v0.59 or when using the Hermes engine on React Native < 0.64) on Android. In such cases, Immer will fallback to an ES5 compatible implementation which works identically, but is a bit slower.

- Since version 6, support for the fallback implementation has to be explicitly enabled by calling `enableES5()`.
- Version 10 drops the fallback implementation fully, and cannot be used in browsers / engines that don't support Proxy.
